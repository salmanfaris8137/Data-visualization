A comprehensive Sales Report Dashboard! This interactive dashboard provides valuable insights into sales performance,
breaking down data by category, sales representative, month, city, and product. 
Key visualizations include a pie chart showing category sales proportions, bar charts displaying rep and monthly sales figures,
a line chart tracking city sales trends, and a column chart comparing product revenue. With this powerful analytics tool, 
stakeholders can easily monitor sales metrics, identify top performers, and make data-driven decisions to drive business growth. 
I'm thrilled to showcase my skills in data visualization and business intelligence using the powerful capabilities of Power BI.
